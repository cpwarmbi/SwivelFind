# SwivelFind
Repo for SwivelFind, a 360 Degree (non-continuous) Swiveling Rangefinder. Final Project for EEC 172

Swivelfind is a swiveling rangefinder that has the ability to turn 360 degrees (non-continuous) based on user control via TV remote. At any angle, the user may choose to find the distance of the closest object in the rangefinderâ€™s sight. When a distance is requested, the angle that the rangefinder is at relative to its starting position and the distance of the object is stored locally and displayed via OLED (as well as the previous measurement). Any older measurements are stored in the cloud via AWS.
